## Overview
1. A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables <ins>insert operations</ins> to be performed at one end called `REAR` and <ins>delete operations</ins> to be performed at another end called `FRONT`.
2. Queue is referred to be as `First In First Out` list.
3. For example, people waiting in line for a rail ticket form a queue.

## Applications of Queue
Due to the fact that queue performs actions on first in first out basis which is quite fair for the ordering of actions. There are various applications of queues discussed as below.

1. Queues are widely used as waiting lists for a single shared resource like printer, disk, CPU.
2. Queues are used in asynchronous transfer of data (where data is not being transferred at the same rate between two processes) for eg. pipes, file IO, sockets.
3. Queues are used as buffers in most of the applications like MP3 media player, CD player, etc.
4. Queue are used to maintain the play list in media players in order to add and remove the songs from the play-list.
5. Queues are used in operating systems for handling interrupts.

## Representation
#### Array representation of Queue
We can easily represent queue by using linear arrays. There are two variables i.e. `front` and `rear`, that are implemented in the case of every queue. `Front` and `rear` variables point to the position from where insertions and deletions are performed in a queue. Initially, the value of front and queue is `-1` which represents an empty queue. Array representation of a queue containing 5 elements along with the respective values of front and rear, is shown in the following figure.
![ZG2M38.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/07/02/ZG2M38.png)

###### Insertion of Array Representation
The above figure shows the queue of characters forming the English word "HELLO". Since, No deletion is performed in the queue till now, therefore the value of front remains -1 . However, the value of rear increases by one every time an insertion is performed in the queue. After inserting an element into the queue shown in the above figure, the queue will look something like following. The value of rear will become 5 while the value of front remains same.

###### Deletion of Array Representation
After deleting an element, the value of front will increase from -1 to 0. however, the queue will look something like following.

###### Implementation of Array Representation in CPP

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define MAXSIZE 5

using namespace std;

int front = -1,rear = -1;
int Queue[MAXSIZE];

void Insertion() {
	int value;
	cout << "Please Enter a value: ";
	cin >> value;

	if(rear == MAXSIZE-1) {
		cout << "OVERFLOW..." << endl;

		return;
	}

	if(rear == -1 && front == -1) {
		rear = 0;
		front = 0;
	} else {
		rear = rear + 1;
	}

	Queue[rear] = value;
	cout << "\nInsert a Value Successfully!" << endl;
}

void Deletion() {
	if(front == -1 || front > rear) {
		cout << "Underflow..." << endl;
	}

	if(front == rear) {
		front = -1;
		rear = -1;
	} else {
		front = front + 1;
	}

	cout << "Value has been deleted." << endl;
}


void Display() {
	if(rear == -1) {
		cout << "Empty Queue." << endl;
	} else {
		for(int i = front;i <= rear;++i) {
			cout << Queue[i] << "\t";
		}
	}

	cout << "\n" << endl;
}

int main() {

	int choice;

	while(choice != 4) {
		cout << "1.Insert an element" << endl;
		cout << "2.Delete an element" << endl;
		cout << "3.Display the queue" << endl;
		cout << "4.Exit" << endl;

		cout << "Please enter a choice: ";
		cin >> choice;

		switch(choice) {
			case 1: {
				Insertion();
				break;
			}
			case 2: {
				Deletion();
				break;
			}
			case 3: {
				Display();
				break;
			}
			case 4: {
				break;
			}
			default:{
				cout << "Please Enter a valid Value!" << endl;
			}
		}


	}

	return 0;
}

```

#### Linked List implementation of Queue
Due to the drawbacks discussed in the previous section of this tutorial, the array implementation can not be used for the large scale applications where the queues are implemented. One of the alternative of array implementation is linked list implementation of queue.

The storage requirement of linked representation of a queue with n elements is `o(n)` while the time requirement for operations is `o(1)`.

In a linked queue, each node of the queue consists of two parts i.e. data part and the link part. Each element of the queue points to its immediate next element in the memory.

In the linked queue, there are two pointers maintained in the memory i.e. front pointer and rear pointer. The `front pointer` contains the address of the starting element of the queue while the `rear pointer` contains the address of the last element of the queue.

Insertion and deletions are performed at rear and front end respectively. If front and rear both are NULL, it indicates that the queue is empty.

The linked representation of queue is shown in the following figure.

![ZGxeyQ.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/07/02/ZGxeyQ.png)

###### Insertion of Linked List implementation
The insert operation append the queue by adding an element to the end of the queue. The new element will be the last element of the queue.

Firstly, allocate the memory for the new node ptr by using the following statement.
```cpp
ptr = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
```

There can be the two scenario of inserting this new node ptr into the linked queue.

In the first scenario, we insert element into an empty queue. In this case, the condition `front = NULL` becomes true. Now, the new element will be added as the only element of the queue and the next pointer of front and rear pointer both, will point to `NULL`.
```cpp
ptr->data = value;

if(front == NULL) {
	front = ptr;
	rear = ptr;
	front->next = NULL;
	rear->next = NULL;
}
```

In the second case, the queue contains more than one element. The condition `front = NULL` becomes false. In this scenario, we need to update the end pointer rear so that the next pointer of rear will point to the new node `ptr`. Since, this is a linked queue, hence we also need to make the rear pointer point to the newly added node `ptr`. We also need to make the next pointer of rear point to `NULL`.

```cpp
rear->next = ptr;
rear = ptr;
rear->next = NULL;
```

In this way, the element is inserted into the queue. The algorithm and the C implementation is given as follows.

###### Deletion of Linked List implementation
Deletion operation removes the element that is first inserted among all the queue elements. Firstly, we need to check either the list is empty or not. The condition `front == NULL` becomes true if the list is empty, in this case , we simply write underflow on the console and make exit.

Otherwise, we will delete the element that is pointed by the pointer front. For this purpose, copy the node pointed by the front pointer into the pointer `ptr`. Now, shift the front pointer, point to its next node and free the node pointed by the node `ptr`. This is done by using the following statements.
```cpp
struct node *ptr;

if(front == NULL) {
	cout << "UNDERFLOW..." << endl;
	return;
} else {
	ptr = front;
	front = front->next;
	free(ptr);

	cout << "Value has been deleted." << endl;
}
```

###### Implementation of Linked List implementation in CPP
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

struct node{
	int data;
	struct node *next;
};

struct node *front;
struct node *rear;

void Insertion() {
	struct node *ptr;
	int value;

	ptr = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));

	if(ptr == NULL) {
		cout << "OVERFLOW..." << endl;
		return;
	} else {
		cout << "Please Enter a value: ";
		cin >> value;
		ptr->data = value;

		if(front == NULL) {
			front = ptr;
			rear = ptr;
			front->next = NULL;
			rear->next = NULL;
		} else {
			rear->next = ptr;
			rear = ptr;
			rear->next = NULL;
		}

		cout << "\nInsert a Value Successfully!" << endl;
	}
}

void Deletion() {
	struct node *ptr;

	if(front == NULL) {
		cout << "UNDERFLOW..." << endl;
		return;
	} else {
		ptr = front;
		front = front->next;
		free(ptr);

		cout << "Value has been deleted." << endl;
	}
}


void Display() {
	struct node *ptr;
	ptr = front;

	if(front == NULL) {
		cout << "Empty Queue." << endl;
	} else {
		while(ptr != NULL) {
			cout << ptr->data << " " ;
			ptr = ptr->next;
		}
	}

	cout << "\n" << endl;
}

int main() {

	int choice;

	while(choice != 4) {
		cout << "1.Insert an element" << endl;
		cout << "2.Delete an element" << endl;
		cout << "3.Display the queue" << endl;
		cout << "4.Exit" << endl;

		cout << "Please enter a choice: ";
		cin >> choice;

		switch(choice) {
			case 1: {
				Insertion();
				break;
			}
			case 2: {
				Deletion();
				break;
			}
			case 3: {
				Display();
				break;
			}
			case 4: {
				break;
			}
			default:{
				cout << "Please Enter a valid Value!" << endl;
			}
		}


	}

	return 0;
}

```
