## Overview
1. A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables <ins>insert operations</ins> to be performed at one end called `REAR` and <ins>delete operations</ins> to be performed at another end called `FRONT`.
2. Queue is referred to be as `First In First Out` list.
3. For example, people waiting in line for a rail ticket form a queue.

## Applications of Queue
Due to the fact that queue performs actions on first in first out basis which is quite fair for the ordering of actions. There are various applications of queues discussed as below.

1. Queues are widely used as waiting lists for a single shared resource like printer, disk, CPU.
2. Queues are used in asynchronous transfer of data (where data is not being transferred at the same rate between two processes) for eg. pipes, file IO, sockets.
3. Queues are used as buffers in most of the applications like MP3 media player, CD player, etc.
4. Queue are used to maintain the play list in media players in order to add and remove the songs from the play-list.
5. Queues are used in operating systems for handling interrupts.

## Representation
#### Array representation of Queue
We can easily represent queue by using linear arrays. There are two variables i.e. `front` and `rear`, that are implemented in the case of every queue. `Front` and `rear` variables point to the position from where insertions and deletions are performed in a queue. Initially, the value of front and queue is `-1` which represents an empty queue. Array representation of a queue containing 5 elements along with the respective values of front and rear, is shown in the following figure.

###### Insertion of Array Representation
The above figure shows the queue of characters forming the English word "HELLO". Since, No deletion is performed in the queue till now, therefore the value of front remains -1 . However, the value of rear increases by one every time an insertion is performed in the queue. After inserting an element into the queue shown in the above figure, the queue will look something like following. The value of rear will become 5 while the value of front remains same.

###### Deletion of Array Representation
After deleting an element, the value of front will increase from -1 to 0. however, the queue will look something like following.

###### Implementation of Array Representation in CPP

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define MAXSIZE 5

using namespace std;

int front = -1,rear = -1;
int Queue[MAXSIZE];

void Insertion() {
	int value;
	cout << "Please Enter a value: ";
	cin >> value;

	if(rear == MAXSIZE-1) {
		cout << "OVERFLOW..." << endl;

		return;
	}

	if(rear == -1 && front == -1) {
		rear = 0;
		front = 0;
	} else {
		rear = rear + 1;
	}

	Queue[rear] = value;
	cout << "\nInsert a Value Successfully!" << endl;
}

void Deletion() {
	if(front == -1 || front > rear) {
		cout << "Underflow..." << endl;
	}

	if(front == rear) {
		front = -1;
		rear = -1;
	} else {
		front = front + 1;
	}

	cout << "Value has been deleted." << endl;
}


void Display() {
	if(rear == -1) {
		cout << "Empty Queue." << endl;
	} else {
		for(int i = front;i <= rear;++i) {
			cout << Queue[i] << "\t";
		}
	}

	cout << "\n" << endl;
}

int main() {

	int choice;

	while(choice != 4) {
		cout << "1.Insert an element" << endl;
		cout << "2.Delete an element" << endl;
		cout << "3.Display the queue" << endl;
		cout << "4.Exit" << endl;

		cout << "Please enter a choice: ";
		cin >> choice;

		switch(choice) {
			case 1: {
				Insertion();
				break;
			}
			case 2: {
				Deletion();
				break;
			}
			case 3: {
				Display();
				break;
			}
			case 4: {
				break;
			}
			default:{
				cout << "Please Enter a valid Value!" << endl;
			}
		}


	}

	return 0;
}

```
