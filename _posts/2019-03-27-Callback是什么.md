## What is a Callback?
***Simply put***<br>
- A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — hence the name ‘call back’.<br>
***More complexly put***<br>
- In `JavaScript`, `functions` are `objects`. Because of this, `functions` can take `functions` as arguments, and can be returned by other `functions`. `Functions` that do this are called `higher-order functions`. Any `function` that is passed as an argument is called a `callback function`.<br>

## Why do we need Callbacks?
`Callbacks` are a way to make sure certain code doesn’t execute until other code has already finished execution.

## Create a Callback
创建&#58;
```javascript
function doHomework(subject, callback) {
  alert(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);
  callback();
}
```
调用&#58;
```javascript
doHomework('math', function() {
  alert('Finished my homework');
});
```

But `callback functions` don’t always have to be defined in our function call. They can be defined elsewhere in our code like this:
```javascript
function doHomework(subject, callback) {
  alert(`Starting my ${subject} homework.`);
  callback();
}

function alertFinished(){
  alert('Finished my homework');
}

doHomework('math', alertFinished);
```

## A real world example
When you make requests to an API, you have to wait for the response before you can act on that response.
Here’s what the request looks like:
```javascript
T.get('search/tweets', params, function(err, data, response) {
  if(!err){
    // This is where the magic will happen
  } else {
    console.log(err);
  }
})
```
- `T.get` simply means we are making a get request to Twitter
- There are three parameters in this request: 
  - `search/tweets`, which is the route of our request,
  - `params` which are our search parameters
  - `anonymous function` which is our callback.
