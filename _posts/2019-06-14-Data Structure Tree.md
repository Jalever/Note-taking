## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children

## Full Binary Tree
A full Binary tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node has either two or no children.

## Complete Binary Tree
A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences
1. Every level must be completely filled
2. All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
3. The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesn’t have to be a full binary tree.
