## Introduction to Stack
1. Stack is an ordered list in which, insertion and deletion can be performed only at one end that is called top.
2. Stack is a recursive data structure having pointer to its top element.
3. Stacks are sometimes called as Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) lists i.e. the element which is inserted first in the stack, will be deleted last from the stack.

## Application of Stack
1. Recursion
2. Expression evaluations and conversions
3. Parsing
4. Browsers
5. Editors
6. Tree Traversals

## Operations on Stack
There are various operations which can be performed on stack.

#### push
Adding an element onto the stack

#### pop
Removing an element from the stack

#### peek
Look all the elements of stack without removing them.

## How the Stack grow

#### Scenario 1 Stack is empty
The stack is called empty if it doesn't contain any element inside it. At this stage, the value of variable top is -1.

#### Scenario 2 Stack is not empty
Value of top will get increased by 1 every time when we add any element to the stack. In the following stack, After adding first element, top = 2.

#### Scenario 3 Deletion of an element
Value of top will get decreased by 1 whenever an element is deleted from the stack.

In the following stack, after deleting 10 from the stack, top = 1.

## Top and its value
