## Common Definition
#### Coefficient
In <strong>Mathematics</strong>, a <strong>Coefficient</strong> is a multiplicative factor in some term of a <ins>polynomial</ins>, a <ins>series</ins>, or <ins>any expression</ins>; it is usually a number, but may be any expression. In the latter case, the variables appearing in the coefficients are often called <strong>Parameter</strong>s, and must be clearly distinguished from the other variables.

For example, in
![ZOspFA.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/07/18/ZOspFA.png)
the first two terms respectively have the coefficients `7` and `−3`. The third term `1.5` is a constant coefficient. The final term does not have any explicitly written coefficient, but is considered to have coefficient `1`, since multiplying by that factor would not change the term.

Often </strong>Coefficient</strong>s are numbers as in this example, although they could be parameters of the problem or any expression in these parameters. In such a case one must clearly distinguish between symbols representing variables and symbols representing parameters. Following <strong>René Descartes</strong>, the variables are often denoted by `x, y, ...`, and the parameters by `a, b, c, ...`, but it is not always the case. For example, if `y` is considered as a parameter in the above expression, the coefficient of `x` is `−3y`, and the constant coefficient is `1.5 + y`.

When one writes

it is generally supposed that `x` is the only variable and that `a`, `b` and `c` are parameters; thus the constant coefficient is `c` in this case.
