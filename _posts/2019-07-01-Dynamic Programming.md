## Overview
<strong>Dynamic Programming</strong> is both a <strong>Mathematical Optimization Method</strong> and a <strong>Computer Programming Method</strong>. The method was developed by <ins>Richard Bellman</ins> in the 1950s and has found applications in numerous fields, from <strong>Aerospace Engineering</strong> to <strong>Economics</strong>. `In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner`. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.

If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that <strong>Dynamic Programming Methods</strong> are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of the sub-problems. In the optimization literature this relationship is called the <strong>Bellman Equation</strong>.
