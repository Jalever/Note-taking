## Requirements
We all know that re-using code as much as possible is generally a good idea. Sharing code between components saves us money, energy, and, most importantly, time.

Re-using code hasn’t been so easy for the complex HTML. You’ve sometimes had to write to render custom UI controls, and using them multiple times can turn your page into a mess if you are not careful.

Here’s where Web Components come in.<b>Web Components is a suite of different technologies which allow you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and to utilize them in your web apps.</b>

For example, web components let us define custom elements in `HTML` files.
```js
<body>
    <app-button>Hello</app-button>
</body>
```
