## Introduction
In TypeScript, we allow developers to use object-oriented class-based approach, and compile them down to JavaScript that works across all major browsers and platforms, without having to wait for the next version of JavaScript

## Classes

Let’s take a look at a simple class-based example:

```js
class Greeter {
    greeting: string;
    constructor(message: string) {
        this.greeting = message;
    }
    greet() {
        return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
    }
}

let greeter = new Greeter("world");
```

## Inheritance

In TypeScript, we can use common object-oriented patterns. One of the most fundamental patterns in class-based programming is being able to extend existing classes to create new ones using inheritance.

Let’s take a look at an example:

```js
class Animal {
    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {
        console.log(`Animal moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    bark() {
        console.log('Woof! Woof!');
    }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.bark();
dog.move(10);
dog.bark();
```

This example shows the most basic inheritance feature: classes inherit properties and methods from base classes. Here, Dog is a derived class that derives from the Animal base class using the extends keyword. Derived classes are often called `subclasses`, and base classes are often called `superclasses`.

Because `Dog` extends the functionality from Animal, we were able to create an instance of `Dog` that could both `bark()` and `move()`

Let’s now look at a more complex example.

```js
class Animal {
    name: string;
    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
    move(distanceInMeters: number = 0) {
        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
    }
}

class Snake extends Animal {
    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }
    move(distanceInMeters = 5) {
        console.log("Slithering...");
        super.move(distanceInMeters);
    }
}

class Horse extends Animal {
    constructor(name: string) { super(name); }
    move(distanceInMeters = 45) {
        console.log("Galloping...");
        super.move(distanceInMeters);
    }
}

let sam = new Snake("Sammy the Python");
let tom: Animal = new Horse("Tommy the Palomino");

sam.move();
tom.move(34);

//output
// Slithering...
// Sammy the Python moved 5m.
// Galloping...
// Tommy the Palomino moved 34m.
```

One difference from the prior example is that each derived class that contains a constructor function must call `super()` which will execute the constructor of the base class. What’s more, before we ever access a property on `this` in a constructor body, we have to call `super()`. This is an important rule that TypeScript will enforce.

## Public, private, and protected modifiers

#### Public by default

In TypeScript, each member is `public` by default.

You may still mark a member public explicitly.

```js
class Animal {
    public name: string;
    public constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
    public move(distanceInMeters: number) {
        console.log(`${this.name} moved ${distanceInMeters}m.`);
    }
}
```

#### Understanding private

When a member is marked private, it cannot be accessed from outside of its containing class. For example:

```js
class Animal {
    private name: string;
    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
}

new Animal("Cat").name; // Error: 'name' is private;
```

TypeScript is a structural type system. When we compare two different types, regardless of where they came from, if the types of all members are compatible, then we say the types themselves are compatible.

However, when comparing types that have `private` and `protected` members, we treat these types differently. For two types to be considered compatible, if one of them has a `private` member, then the other must have a `private` member that originated in the same declaration. The same applies to `protected` members.

Let’s look at an example to better see how this plays out in practice:

```js
class Animal {
    private name: string;
    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
}

class Rhino extends Animal {
    constructor() { super("Rhino"); }
}

class Employee {
    private name: string;
    constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
}

let animal = new Animal("Goat");
let rhino = new Rhino();
let employee = new Employee("Bob");

animal = rhino;
animal = employee; // Error: 'Animal' and 'Employee' are not compatible
```

In this example, we have an `Animal` and a `Rhino`, with `Rhino` being a subclass of `Animal`. We also have a new class `Employee` that looks identical to `Animal` in terms of shape. We create some instances of these classes and then try to assign them to each other to see what will happen. Because `Animal` and `Rhino` share the private side of their shape from the same declaration of private `name: string` in `Animal`, they are compatible. However, this is not the case for `Employee`. When we try to assign from an `Employee` to `Animal` we get an error that these types are not compatible. Even though `Employee` also has a private member called name, it’s not the one we declared in `Animal`

#### Understanding protected
The `protected` modifier acts much like the private modifier with the exception that members declared protected can also be accessed within deriving classes. For example,

```js
class Person {
    protected name: string;
    constructor(name: string) { this.name = name; }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    private department: string;

    constructor(name: string, department: string) {
        super(name);
        this.department = department;
    }

    public getElevatorPitch() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;
    }
}

let howard = new Employee("Howard", "Sales");
console.log(howard.getElevatorPitch());
console.log(howard.name); // error
```

Notice that while we can’t use `name` from outside of `Person`, we can still use it from within an instance method of `Employee` because `Employee` derives from `Person`.

A constructor may also be marked `protected`. This means that the class cannot be instantiated outside of its containing class, but can be extended. For example,

```js
class Person {
    protected name: string;
    protected constructor(theName: string) { this.name = theName; }
}

// Employee can extend Person
class Employee extends Person {
    private department: string;

    constructor(name: string, department: string) {
        super(name);
        this.department = department;
    }

    public getElevatorPitch() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I work in ${this.department}.`;
    }
}

let howard = new Employee("Howard", "Sales");
let john = new Person("John"); // Error: The 'Person' constructor is protected
```

## Readonly modifier

You can make properties readonly by using the readonly keyword. Readonly properties must be initialized at their declaration or in the constructor.

```js
class Octopus {
    readonly name: string;
    readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;
    constructor (theName: string) {
        this.name = theName;
    }
}
let dad = new Octopus("Man with the 8 strong legs");
dad.name = "Man with the 3-piece suit"; // error! name is readonly
```

#### Parameter properties
This is needed in order to have the value of `theName` accessible after the `Octopus` constructor is executed. Parameter properties let you create and initialize a member in one place. Here’s a further revision of the previous `Octopus` class using a parameter property:

```js
class Octopus {
    readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;
    constructor(readonly name: string) {
    }
}
```

Notice how we dropped `theName` altogether and just use the shortened readonly name: string parameter on the constructor to create and initialize the name member. We’ve consolidated the declarations and assignment into one location.

Parameter properties are declared by prefixing a constructor parameter with an accessibility modifier or readonly, or both. Using private for a parameter property declares and initializes a private member; likewise, the same is done for public, protected, and readonly.

## Accessors
TypeScript supports getters/setters as a way of intercepting accesses to a member of an object. This gives you a way of having finer-grained control over how a member is accessed on each object.

Let’s convert a simple class to use get and set. First, let’s start with an example without getters and setters.

```js
class Employee {
    fullName: string;
}

let employee = new Employee();
employee.fullName = "Bob Smith";
if (employee.fullName) {
    console.log(employee.fullName);
}
```

While allowing people to randomly set fullName directly is pretty handy, this might get us in trouble if people can change names on a whim.

In this version, we check to make sure the user has a secret passcode available before we allow them to modify the employee. We do this by replacing the direct access to fullName with a set that will check the passcode. We add a corresponding get to allow the previous example to continue to work seamlessly.

```js
let passcode = "secret passcode";

class Employee {
    private _fullName: string;

    get fullName(): string {
        return this._fullName;
    }

    set fullName(newName: string) {
        if (passcode && passcode == "secret passcode") {
            this._fullName = newName;
        }
        else {
            console.log("Error: Unauthorized update of employee!");
        }
    }
}

let employee = new Employee();
employee.fullName = "Bob Smith";
if (employee.fullName) {
    console.log(employee.fullName);
}
```

## Static Properties
Up to this point, we’ve only talked about the instance members of the class, those that show up on the object when it’s instantiated. We can also create static members of a class, those that are visible on the class itself rather than on the instances. In this example, we use static on the origin, as it’s a general value for all grids. <ins>Each instance accesses this value through prepending the name of the class.</ins> Similarly to prepending this. in front of instance accesses, here we prepend Grid. in front of static accesses.
```js
class Grid {
    static origin = {x: 0, y: 0};
    calculateDistanceFromOrigin(point: {x: number; y: number;}) {
        let xDist = (point.x - Grid.origin.x);
        let yDist = (point.y - Grid.origin.y);
        return Math.sqrt(xDist * xDist + yDist * yDist) / this.scale;
    }
    constructor (public scale: number) { }
}

let grid1 = new Grid(1.0);  // 1x scale
let grid2 = new Grid(5.0);  // 5x scale

console.log(grid1.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));
console.log(grid2.calculateDistanceFromOrigin({x: 10, y: 10}));

```

## Abstract Classes
Abstract classes are base classes from which other classes may be derived. They may not be instantiated directly. Unlike an interface, an abstract class may contain implementation details for its members. The abstract keyword is used to define abstract classes as well as abstract methods within an abstract class.
```js
abstract class Animal {
    abstract makeSound(): void;
    move(): void {
        console.log("roaming the earth...");
    }
}
```

Methods within an abstract class that are marked as abstract do not contain an implementation and must be implemented in derived classes. Abstract methods share a similar syntax to interface methods. Both define the signature of a method without including a method body. However, abstract methods must include the abstract keyword and may optionally include access modifiers.

```js
abstract class Department {

    constructor(public name: string) {
    }

    printName(): void {
        console.log("Department name: " + this.name);
    }

    abstract printMeeting(): void; // must be implemented in derived classes
}

class AccountingDepartment extends Department {

    constructor() {
        super("Accounting and Auditing"); // constructors in derived classes must call super()
    }

    printMeeting(): void {
        console.log("The Accounting Department meets each Monday at 10am.");
    }

    generateReports(): void {
        console.log("Generating accounting reports...");
    }
}

let department: Department; // ok to create a reference to an abstract type
department = new Department(); // error: cannot create an instance of an abstract class
department = new AccountingDepartment(); // ok to create and assign a non-abstract subclass
department.printName();
department.printMeeting();
department.generateReports(); // error: method doesn't exist on declared abstract type
```

## Advanced Techniques
#### Constructor functions

#### Using a class as an interface
As we said in the previous section, a class declaration creates two things: a type representing instances of the class and a constructor function. Because classes create types, you can use them in the same places you would be able to use interfaces
```js
class Point {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}

interface Point3d extends Point {
    z: number;
}

let point3d: Point3d = {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3};
```
