## Cohesiveness and Coupling
Cohesiveness measures how well your module and its components are geared towards doing one thing well.

For example, if you have a module dedicated solely to identifying and filtering spam messages, that module probably has high cohesiveness. On the other hand, if you have a module which exposes methods for modifying different kinds of database objects like `user`, `account`, `post` and etc., then that module will have low cohesiveness.

Coupling measures how much component is dependent on the other components.

If the module directly accesses and modifies the data of the other module or some global variable, then that module is tightly coupled and will be harder to make changes to. If the only way for two modules to communicate is by exchanging values through their function parameters, then those modules are loosely coupled.

## Hardcoded dependency and Dependency injection

Hardcoded dependency refers to the module wiring pattern where you hardcode the name of the dependency inside of your module, possibly using require function.

Dependency injection is a wiring pattern where the dependencies are not hardcoded but provided as the input by the external entity instead.

#### Hardcoded dependencies
wiring.js
```js
const { Client } = require('pg');

const client = new Client({
  user: 'dbuser',
  host: 'database.server.com',
  database: 'mydb',
  password: 'secretpassword',
  port: 3211,
})
client.connect();

module.exports = client;
```

source codes of `wiring_hc_movies.js`
```js
const client = require('./db');

exports.listSuggestions = (username, callback) => {
  client.query(`select * from suggestions where username = '${username}'`, (err, res) => {
    //...
  });
}


exports.newSuggestion = (username, callback) => {
  //...
}
```

source codes of `wired_hc_app.js`
```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const {
  newSuggestion,
  listSuggestions,
} = require('./movies');

const app = express()
app.use(bodyParser.json())


app.get('/suggestion/new', (req, res) => {
  const { username } = req.params;
  newSuggestion(username, (err, data) => {
    res.json({ data })
  });
});


app.get('/suggestion/list', (req, res) => {
  const { username } = req.params;
  listSuggestions(username, (err, data) => {
    res.json({ data })
  });
});


app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("App started")
});


module.exports = app
```

###### Pros
- Intuitive and easy to understand — you can easily understand and follow the workflow of the program because all the dependencies are statically injected.
- Easier to debug

###### Cons
- Modules are less flexible and are tightly coupled with their dependencies — in our example you can’t use different database instance without making the direct change to the movies module.
- Harder to unit test — since our dependencies are hardcoded it’s harder to provide dummy data for unit tests

#### Dependency injection

source codes of `di_db.js`
```js
const { Client } = require('pg');


module.exports = (settings) => {
  const client = new Client(settings)
  client.connect();

  return client;
}

```

source codes of `di_movies.js`
```js
module.exports = (db) => {
  const movieSuggestion = {};
  movieSuggestion.listSuggestions = (username, callback) => {
    db.query(`select * from suggestions where username = '${username}'`, (err, res) => {
      //...
    });
  }


  movieSuggestion.newSuggestion = (username, callback) => {
    //...
  }

  return movieSuggestion;
}
```

source codes of `di_app.js`
```js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const dbFactory = require('./db');
const movieFactory = require('./movies');

const app = express()
app.use(bodyParser.json())


const dbSettings = {
  user: 'dbuser',
  host: 'database.server.com',
  database: 'mydb',
  password: 'secretpassword',
  port: 3211,
};


const dbClient = dbFactory(dbSettings);
const movieSuggestion = movieFactory(dbClient);


app.get('/suggestion/new', (req, res) => {
  const { username } = req.params;
  movieSuggestion.newSuggestion(username, (err, data) => {
    res.json({ data })
  });
});


app.get('/suggestion/list', (req, res) => {
  const { username } = req.params;
  movieSuggestion.listSuggestions(username, (err, data) => {
    res.json({ data })
  });
});


app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log("App started")
});


module.exports = app
```

This is one of the main concepts in dependency injection: move handling the dependencies to the higher level components, which will be responsible for distributing them to the lower-level components.

###### Pros

- Higher reusability — In our case it’s much easier to use our movie suggestion service with different database instances.

- Easier unit testing — Supplying dummy data for unit testing becomes trivial.

###### Cons

- Dependencies are wired at a runtime — since our dependencies are wired to the components at the runtime it’s harder to understand the flow of the logic just by looking at the components. In our example not much complexity is added, but the bigger your app becomes the harder it will be to manage those dependencies.
