As the first argument passed in to <strong>connect</strong>, <strong>mapStateToProps</strong> is used for selecting the part of the data from the store that the connected component needs. Itâ€™s frequently referred to as just <strong>mapState</strong> for short.

- It is called every time the store state changes.
- It receives the entire store state, and should return an object of data this component needs.
