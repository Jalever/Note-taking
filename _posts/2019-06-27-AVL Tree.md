## Overview
AVL Tree is invented by `Adelson-Velsky and Landis` in 1962. The tree is named AVL in honour of its inventors.

AVL Tree can be defined as height balanced binary search tree in which each node is associated with a balance factor which is calculated by `subtracting the height of its right sub-tree from that of its left sub-tree`.

Tree is said to be balanced if balance factor of each node is in between -1 to 1, otherwise, the tree will be unbalanced and need to be balanced.

## Balance Factor
Balance Factor (k) = height (left(k)) - height (right(k))

If balance factor of any node is `-1`, it means that `the left sub-tree` is one level lower than `the right sub-tree`.

If balance factor of any node is `0`, it means that `the left sub-tree` and `right sub-tree` contain equal height.

If balance factor of any node is `1`, it means that `the left sub-tree` is one level higher than `the right sub-tree`.

An AVL tree is given in the following figure. We can see that, balance factor associated with each node is in between -1 and +1. therefore, it is an example of AVL tree.

## Why AVL Tree
AVL tree controls the height of the binary search tree by not letting it to be skewed. The time taken for all operations in a binary search tree of height h is `O(h)`. However, it can be extended to `O(n)` if the BST becomes skewed (i.e. worst case). By limiting this height to `log n`, AVL tree imposes an upper bound on each operation to be `O(log n)` where n is the number of nodes.

## Operations on AVL tree
Due to the fact that, AVL tree is also a binary search tree therefore, all the operations are performed in the same way as they are performed in a binary search tree. Searching and traversing do not lead to the violation in property of AVL tree. However, insertion and deletion are the operations which can violate this property and therefore, they need to be revisited.

#### Insertion
Insertion in AVL tree is performed in the same way as it is performed in a binary search tree. The new node is added into AVL tree as the leaf node. However, it may lead to violation in the AVL tree property and therefore the tree may need balancing.

The tree can be balanced by applying rotations. Rotation is required only if, the balance factor of any node is disturbed upon inserting the new node, otherwise the rotation is not required.

Depending upon the type of insertion, the Rotations are categorized into four categories.

The first two rotations are single rotations and the next two rotations are double rotations. To have an unbalanced tree, we at least need a tree of height 2. With this simple tree, let's understand them one by one.

###### Left Rotation
If a tree becomes unbalanced, when a node is inserted into the right subtree of the right subtree, then we perform a single left rotation

![ZuYTqx.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuYTqx.jpg)

In our example, node A has become unbalanced as a node is inserted in the right subtree of A's right subtree. We perform the left rotation by making A the left-subtree of B.

###### Right Rotation
AVL tree may become unbalanced, if a node is inserted in the left subtree of the left subtree. The tree then needs a right rotation.

![ZutpLt.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZutpLt.jpg)

As depicted, the unbalanced node becomes the right child of its left child by performing a right rotation.

###### Left Right Rotation
Double rotations are slightly complex version of already explained versions of rotations. To understand them better, we should take note of each action performed while rotation. Let's first check how to perform Left-Right rotation. A left-right rotation is a combination of left rotation followed by right rotation.

![Zut8W4.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/Zut8W4.jpg)
A node has been inserted into the right subtree of the left subtree. This makes C an unbalanced node. These scenarios cause AVL tree to perform left-right rotation.

![ZutYl9.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZutYl9.jpg)
We first perform the left rotation on the left subtree of C. This makes A, the left subtree of B.

![ZutNO1.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZutNO1.jpg)
Node C is still unbalanced, however now, it is because of the left-subtree of the left-subtree.

![Zutdw6.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/Zutdw6.jpg)
We shall now right-rotate the tree, making B the new root node of this subtree. C now becomes the right subtree of its own left subtree.

![Zut6ld.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/Zut6ld.jpg)
The tree is now balanced.


###### Right Left Rotation
The second type of double rotation is Right-Left Rotation. It is a combination of right rotation followed by left rotation.

![ZuNCc9.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNCc9.jpg)
A node has been inserted into the left subtree of the right subtree. This makes A, an unbalanced node with balance factor 2.

![ZuNFn1.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNFn1.jpg)
First, we perform the right rotation along C node, making C the right subtree of its own left subtree B. Now, B becomes the right subtree of A.

![ZuNk0x.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNk0x.jpg)
Node A is still unbalanced because of the right subtree of its right subtree and requires a left rotation.

![ZuNVAK.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNVAK.jpg)    
A left rotation is performed by making B the new root node of the subtree. A becomes the left subtree of its right subtree B.

![ZuNn9e.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNn9e.jpg)
The tree is now balanced.

###### Construction an AVL Tree by inserting the following elements in the given order
```text
63, 9, 19, 27, 18, 108, 99, 81
```
The process of constructing an AVL tree from the given set of elements is shown in the following figure.

At each step, we must calculate the balance factor for every node, if it is found to be more than 2 or less than -2, then we need a rotation to rebalance the tree. The type of rotation will be estimated by the location of the inserted element with respect to the critical node.

All the elements are inserted in order to maintain the order of binary search tree.
