## Overview
AVL Tree is invented by `Adelson-Velsky and Landis` in 1962. The tree is named AVL in honour of its inventors.

AVL Tree can be defined as height balanced binary search tree in which each node is associated with a balance factor which is calculated by `subtracting the height of its right sub-tree from that of its left sub-tree`.

Tree is said to be balanced if balance factor of each node is in between -1 to 1, otherwise, the tree will be unbalanced and need to be balanced.

The AVL tree and other self-balancing search trees like `Red Black` are useful to get all basic operations done in `O(log n)` time. The AVL trees are more balanced compared to `Red-Black Tree`, but they may cause more rotations during insertion and deletion. So if your application involves many frequent insertions and deletions, then `Red Black Tree` should be preferred. And if the insertions and deletions are less frequent and search is the more frequent operation, then AVL tree should be preferred over `Red Black Tree`.

## Balance Factor
Balance Factor (k) = height (left(k)) - height (right(k))

If balance factor of any node is `-1`, it means that `the left sub-tree` is one level lower than `the right sub-tree`.

If balance factor of any node is `0`, it means that `the left sub-tree` and `right sub-tree` contain equal height.

If balance factor of any node is `1`, it means that `the left sub-tree` is one level higher than `the right sub-tree`.

![Zul1v6.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/Zul1v6.png)

An AVL tree is given in the following figure. We can see that, balance factor associated with each node is in between -1 and +1. therefore, it is an example of AVL tree.

## Why AVL Tree
AVL tree controls the height of the binary search tree by not letting it to be skewed. The time taken for all operations in a binary search tree of height h is `O(h)`. However, it can be extended to `O(n)` if the BST becomes skewed (i.e. worst case). By limiting this height to `log n`, AVL tree imposes an upper bound on each operation to be `O(log n)` where n is the number of nodes.

## Operations on AVL tree
Due to the fact that, AVL tree is also a binary search tree therefore, all the operations are performed in the same way as they are performed in a binary search tree. Searching and traversing do not lead to the violation in property of AVL tree. However, insertion and deletion are the operations which can violate this property and therefore, they need to be revisited.

#### Insertion
Insertion in AVL tree is performed in the same way as it is performed in a binary search tree. The new node is added into AVL tree as the leaf node. However, it may lead to violation in the AVL tree property and therefore the tree may need balancing.

The tree can be balanced by applying rotations. Rotation is required only if, the balance factor of any node is disturbed upon inserting the new node, otherwise the rotation is not required.

Depending upon the type of insertion, the Rotations are categorized into four categories.

The first two rotations are single rotations and the next two rotations are double rotations. To have an unbalanced tree, we at least need a tree of height 2. With this simple tree, let's understand them one by one.

###### Basic Operations that can be performed to rebalance a BST
1.<strong>Left Rotation</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a tree becomes unbalanced, when a node is inserted into the right subtree of the right subtree, then we perform a single left rotation

![ZuYTqx.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuYTqx.jpg)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our example, node A has become unbalanced as a node is inserted in the right subtree of A's right subtree. We perform the left rotation by making A the left-subtree of B.

Source Codes explained:

[![ZMAAxg.md.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZMAAxg.md.png)](https://imgchr.com/i/ZMAAxg)

```cpp
Node *LeftRotate(Node *node) {
	Node *rightChild = node->right;
	Node *subLeftChild = rightChild->left;

	rightChild->left = node;
	node->right = subLeftChild;

	node->height = getMaximum(getNodeHeight(node->left), getNodeHeight(node->right)) + 1;
	rightChild->height = getMaximum(getNodeHeight(rightChild->left), getNodeHeight(rightChild->right)) + 1;

	return rightChild;
}
```

2.<strong>Right Rotation</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVL tree may become unbalanced, if a node is inserted in the left subtree of the left subtree. The tree then needs a right rotation.

![ZutpLt.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZutpLt.jpg)

Source Codes explained:

[![ZMALoq.md.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZMALoq.md.png)](https://imgchr.com/i/ZMALoq)

```cpp
Node *RightRotate(Node *node) {
	Node *leftChild = node->left;
	Node *subRightChild = leftChild->right;

	leftChild->right = node;
	node->left = subRightChild;

	node->height = getMaximum(getNodeHeight(node->left), getNodeHeight(node->right)) + 1;
	leftChild->height = getMaximum(getNodeHeight(leftChild->left), getNodeHeight(leftChild->right)) + 1;

	return leftChild;
}
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As depicted, the unbalanced node becomes the right child of its left child by performing a right rotation.

3.<strong>Left Right Double Rotation</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double rotations are slightly complex version of already explained versions of rotations. To understand them better, we should take note of each action performed while rotation. Let's first check how to perform Left-Right rotation. A left-right rotation is a combination of left rotation followed by right rotation.

![Zut8W4.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/Zut8W4.jpg)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A node has been inserted into the right subtree of the left subtree. This makes C an unbalanced node. These scenarios cause AVL tree to perform left-right rotation.

![ZutYl9.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZutYl9.jpg)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first perform the left rotation on the left subtree of C. This makes A, the left subtree of B.

![ZutNO1.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZutNO1.jpg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node C is still unbalanced, however now, it is because of the left-subtree of the left-subtree.

![Zutdw6.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/Zutdw6.jpg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall now right-rotate the tree, making B the new root node of this subtree. C now becomes the right subtree of its own left subtree.

![Zut6ld.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/Zut6ld.jpg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree is now balanced.

4.<strong>Right Left Rotation</strong>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second type of double rotation is Right-Left Rotation. It is a combination of right rotation followed by left rotation.

![ZuNCc9.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNCc9.jpg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A node has been inserted into the left subtree of the right subtree. This makes A, an unbalanced node with balance factor 2.

![ZuNFn1.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNFn1.jpg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we perform the right rotation along C node, making C the right subtree of its own left subtree B. Now, B becomes the right subtree of A.

![ZuNk0x.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNk0x.jpg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Node A is still unbalanced because of the right subtree of its right subtree and requires a left rotation.

![ZuNVAK.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNVAK.jpg)    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A left rotation is performed by making B the new root node of the subtree. A becomes the left subtree of its right subtree B.

![ZuNn9e.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/27/ZuNn9e.jpg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tree is now balanced.

###### Four Possible Cases
Let the newly inserted node be `w`
1. Perform standard BST insert for `w`.
2. Starting from `w`, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let `z` be the first unbalanced node, `y` be the child of `z` that comes on the path from `w` to `z` and `x` be the grandchild of `z` that comes on the path from `w` to `z`.
3. Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with `z`.

There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as `x`, `y` and `z` can be arranged in 4 ways.

Following are the possible 4 arrangements:

1. y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)
2. y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)
3. y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)
4. y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)

Following are the operations to be performed in above mentioned 4 cases. In all of the cases, we only need to re-balance the subtree rooted with z and the complete tree becomes balanced as the height of subtree (After appropriate rotations) rooted with z becomes same as it was before insertion.

1.<strong>Left Left Case</strong>
![ZMSNyq.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZMSNyq.png)

2.<strong>Left Right Case</strong>
![ZMCiwV.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZMCiwV.png)

3.<strong>Right Right Case</strong>

4.<strong>Right Left Case</strong>

###### Implementation for AVL Insertion in CPP
Following is the implementation for AVL Tree Insertion. The following implementation uses the recursive BST insert to insert a new node. In the recursive BST insert, after insertion, we get pointers to all ancestors one by one in a bottom-up manner. So we don’t need parent pointer to travel up. The recursive code itself travels up and visits all the ancestors of the newly inserted node.
1. Perform the normal BST insertion.
2. The current node must be one of the ancestors of the newly inserted node. Update the height of the current node.
3. Get the balance factor (left subtree height – right subtree height) of the current node.
4. If balance factor is greater than `1`, then the current node is unbalanced and we are either in `Left Left case` or `left Right case`. To check whether it is left left case or not, compare the newly inserted key with the key in left subtree root.
5. If balance factor is less than `-1`, then the current node is unbalanced and we are either in `Right Right case` or `Right-Left case`. To check whether it is Right Right case or not, compare the newly inserted key with the key in right subtree root.

###### Time Complexity of Insertion
The rotation operations (left and right rotate) take constant time as only a few pointers are being changed there. Updating the height and getting the balance factor also takes constant time. So the time complexity of AVL insert remains same as BST insert which is O(h) where h is the height of the tree. Since AVL tree is balanced, the height is O(Logn). So time complexity of AVL insert is `O(Logn)`.

#### Deletion
To make sure that the given tree remains AVL after every deletion, we must augment the standard BST delete operation to perform some re-balancing. Following are two basic operations that can be performed to re-balance a BST without violating the BST property (keys(left) < key(root) < keys(right)).
1. Left Rotation
2. Right Rotation

![ZMdo5t.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZMdo5t.png)

Let `w` be the node to be deleted
1. Perform standard BST delete for `w`.
2. Starting from `w`, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let `z` be the first unbalanced node, `y` be the <ins>larger height child</ins> of `z`, and `x` be the <ins>larger height child</ins> of `y`.
3) Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with `z`.

> Note that the definitions of x and y are different from insertion here.

There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as x, y and z can be arranged in 4 ways. Following are the possible 4 arrangements:
1. y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)
2. y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)
3. y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)
4. y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)

Like insertion, following are the operations to be performed in above mentioned 4 cases. Note that, unlike insertion, fixing the node `z` won’t fix the complete AVL tree. After fixing `z`, we may have to fix ancestors of `z` as well

1. <strong>Left Left Case</strong>
![ZMwEqJ.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZMwEqJ.png)

2. <strong>Left Right Case</strong>
![ZMweaR.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZMweaR.png)

3. <strong>Right Right Case</strong>
![ZMwmI1.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZMwmI1.png)

4. <strong>Right Left Case</strong>
![ZMwuPx.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZMwuPx.png)

Unlike insertion, in deletion, after we perform a rotation at `z`, we may have to perform a rotation at ancestors of `z`. Thus, we must continue to trace the path until we reach the root.

Example:
[![ZM0KTs.md.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZM0KTs.md.jpg)](https://imgchr.com/i/ZM0KTs)

[![ZM0Qkn.md.jpg](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/06/28/ZM0Qkn.md.jpg)](https://imgchr.com/i/ZM0Qkn)

A node with value 32 is being deleted. After deleting 32, we travel up and find the first unbalanaced node which is 44. We mark it as `z`, its higher height child as `y` which is 62, and `y`’s higher height child as `x` which could be either 78 or 50 as both are of same height. We have considered 78. Now the case is `Right Right`, so we perform `Left Rotation`.

###### Time Complexity of Deletion
The rotation operations (left and right rotate) take constant time as only few pointers are being changed there. Updating the height and getting the balance factor also take constant time. So the time complexity of AVL delete remains same as BST delete which is O(h) where h is height of the tree. Since AVL tree is balanced, the height is O(Logn). So time complexity of AVL delete is `O(Log n)`.
