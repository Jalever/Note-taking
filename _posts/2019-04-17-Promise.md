## Overview
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

## Syntax
![e9CBJ1.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/07/21/e9CBJ1.png)

#### Parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>executor</strong><br/>
A function that is passed with the arguments `resolve` and `reject`. The `executor` function is executed immediately by the Promise implementation, passing `resolve` and `reject` functions (the executor is called before the `Promise` constructor even returns the created object). The `resolve` and `reject` functions, when called, resolve or reject the promise, respectively. The executor normally initiates some asynchronous work, and then, once that completes, either calls the `resolve` function to resolve the promise or else `rejects` it if an error occurred. If an error is thrown in the executor function, the promise is rejected. The return value of the executor is ignored.

## Description
A `Promise` is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a <i>Promise</i> to supply the value at some point in the future.

A `Promise` is in one of these states:
- <strong>pending</strong>: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- <strong>fulfilled</strong>: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
- <strong>rejected</strong>: meaning that the operation failed.

A pending promise can either be <strong>fulfilled</strong> with a value, or <strong>rejected</strong> with a reason (error). When either of these options happens, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's `then` method are called. (If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being attached.)

As the <strong>Promise.prototype.then()</strong> and <strong>Promise.prototype.catch()</strong> methods return promises, they can be chained.

> A Promise is said to be settled if it is either `fulfilled` or `rejected`, but not pending. You will also hear the term `resolved` used with promises — this means that the promise is settled or “locked in” to match the state of another promise.

## Properties
#### Promise.length
Length property whose value is always 1 (number of constructor arguments).

#### Promise.prototype  
The `Promise.prototype` property represents the prototype for the `Promise` constructor.

`Promise` instances inherit from `Promise.prototype`. You can use the constructor's prototype object to add properties or methods to all `Promise` instances.

## Create a Promise
A Promise object is created using the new keyword and its constructor. This constructor takes as its argument a function, called the "executor function". This function should take two functions as parameters. The first of these functions (resolve) is called when the asynchronous task completes successfully and returns the results of the task as a value. The second (reject) is called when the task fails, and returns the reason for failure, which is typically an error object.

To provide a function with promise functionality, simply have it return a promise:
