## Introduction
Portals provide a `first-class way` to `render children into a DOM node` that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

The <ins>first argument (child)</ins> is any `renderable React child`, such as an <strong>element</strong>, <strong>string</strong>, or <strong>fragment</strong>.
The <ins>second argument (container)</ins> is a `DOM element`.

## Usage
Normally, when you return an element from a component’s render method, it’s mounted into the DOM as a child of the nearest parent node:

However, sometimes it’s useful to insert a child into a different location in the DOM:

A typical use case for portals is when a parent component has an `overflow: hidden` or `z-index` style, but you need the child to visually “break out” of its container. <br>
For example, dialogs, hovercards, and tooltips.

## Event Bubbling Through Portals
Even though a portal can be anywhere in the DOM tree, it behaves like a normal React child in every other way. Features like context work exactly the same regardless of whether the child is a portal, as the portal still exists in the React tree regardless of position in the DOM tree.

This includes event bubbling. An event fired from inside a portal will propagate to ancestors in the containing React tree, even if those elements are not ancestors in the DOM tree. Assuming the following HTML structure:
![elTpFK.png](https://s2.ax1x.com/2019/07/28/elTpFK.png)
A `Parent` component in `#app-root` would be able to catch an uncaught, bubbling event from the sibling node `#modal-root`.

Catching an event bubbling up from a portal in a parent component allows the development of more flexible abstractions that are not inherently reliant on portals. For example, if you render a `<Modal />` component, the parent can capture its events regardless of whether it’s implemented using portals.
