## dependencies
```text
npm install --save-dev
```
<strong>devDependencies</strong> are modules which are only required during development

The shorthand for saving a regular dependency is `-S` instead of `-D`: `npm i -S packagename`

Some good examples of dependencies which would be required at runtime include `React`, `Redux`, `Express`, and `Axios`.
